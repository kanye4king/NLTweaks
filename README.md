# NLTweaks
A handful of tweaks to NetLimiter v4.1.13.0

# Installation:
- Open a command prompt as administrator, type `net stop nlsvc` and press enter
- Simply download the DLL files, close NetLimiter and drag and drop them into your NL Directory
- All features are completely native to NL and this doesn't require any additional exe's to run, just replace dll's one time
- Rename the `NLClient.exe` executable to anything you like, but it NEEDs to be renamed to work for D2
